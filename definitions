OBJECTS: => objects are the entities in the real world
CLASS: => class is like a blueprint of these entities

ACCESS MODIFIERS:
PRIVATE: data & methods accessible inside class
PUBLIC: data & methods accessible to everyone
PROTECTED: data & methods accessible inside class & to its derived class

ENCAPSULATION: => IS wrapping of data & member functions in a single unit called classs.

CONSTRUCTOR:
special method invoked automatically at time of object creation. Used for initialisation.

- same name as class
- Constructor doesn't have a return type
- Only called once (automatically), at object creation
- Memory allocation happens when constructor is called

TYPES:

1. NON paramatirized
2. parametarized
3. copy constructor

THIS: => this is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object.

... this->prop is same as \*(this).prop

COPY CONSTRUCTOR: => special constructor (default) used to copy properties of one object into another.

- SHALLOW & DEEP COPY:
  SHALLOW: => a shallow copy of an object copies all of the member values from one object to another.

DEEP: A deep copy, on the other hand, not only copies the member values but also makes copies of any dynamically allocated memory that the members point to.
